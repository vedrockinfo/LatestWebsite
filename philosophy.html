                            <p>Education is the most complex and challenging issue of our times. It is not just a local
                                or a national concern but a
                                subject of great deliberation worldwide.</p>

                            <p>Even as the world has witnessed vast advances towards globalization and technology makes
                                life much easier, education
                                remains largely unchanged with its19 century objectives and old ethics intact. Current
                                education, like an old injection
                                with an expired date, has at best an uncertain outcome, the goals of which are at odds
                                with the needs of the 21 century.</p>

                            <p>Surely, the change we need in education today is far more than reduce the weight of our
                                children's school bag, replace a
                                few books, integrate the multiple intelligences or better technology, and train our
                                teachers in the methods that
                                accelerate learning?</p>

                            <p>Could we not organize education far better in order to bring out the best and highest in
                                both human nobility and
                                educational excellence and nurture human spirit as well to create a vastly better world
                                for all ?</p>

                            <p>For these, a change in educational direction is urgently needed, not just some tinkering
                                changes, piece-meal approaches
                                and add-ons to an existing system that is founded upon material ethics..</p>

                            <p>Having been fortunate enough to grow up into a family of 'world class' educators, get a
                                'world class' education myself,
                                having had the fortune to travel far and wide to study education in 38 countries and
                                work on education policy at the
                                'best policy institution in the world', I have been forced to think hard about what is a
                                'good' education. I also wonder
                                why after the so-called 'good' education, youth all over the world feel so much
                                hopelessness and lack of direction.</p>

                            <p>What has guided my efforts are Baha'u'llah's words: “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of
                                inestimable value. Education
                                can alone cause it to reveal its treasures and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.”
                                This inspired me to come up with
                                'GEMS—The Global Education Model of Schooling' and along with my colleague Dr Robert J
                                Saunders, I founded the Council
                                for Global Education in Washington, DC. First and foremost, GEMS is a new way of
                                thinking and conceptualising education.
                                Indeed, every child is a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.</p>

                            <p>Through education, we can unravel the gems hidden in each child and enable education to
                                become, at the same time, an
                                instrument of profound social transformation. TS Eliot once wrote:</p>

                            <p>As we review education's goals in the 21st century, an important question we need to ask
                                is: 'Can we convert the Tunnel
                                of Learning, this present educational system, into a Process of Enlightenment?' Other
                                important questions are: 'What are
                                the outcomes we seek from human potential and the educational process?' 'How do we
                                re-organise educational content, its
                                delivery and the educational environment to help every child become both 'good' and
                                'smart', preserve their self-esteem,
                                and bring out the best of gems hidden within each one? Indeed, what do we need to do
                                differently in order to meet the
                                aspirations and address the reality of the world's children?</p>

                            <p>Indeed, how do we re-imagine@school assessments, materials, processes, attitudes,
                                behaviour and training of teachers?
                                How do we orient our staff and ourselves? What syllabus and curriculum do we adopt at
                                each stage of development,
                                pre-primary, primary, middle and senior? What single or mixed age class settings can
                                help our children best at any point
                                in time? Which of the new and varied teaching methods do we adopt and when, from among
                                so many good methods, for
                                example, inquiry, multiple intelligences, constructivism, cooperative learning, thematic
                                work, etc.?</p>

                            <p>It is only when we know the outcomes we want, can we refine our approach to teaching and
                                learning and choose from
                                existing methods and make innovations of our own that integrate research and a
                                scientific understanding of the child.</p>

                            <strong>Together We Can!</strong>

                            <p>What we desperately need is a new education based on a new set of ethics and governed by
                                a new set of principles that
                                are more suited to the needs of the 21 century.</p>

                            <p>In particular, we need to empower ALL our children, not just a few. With even as few as
                                20 children to a class (we
                                rarely have that!), teachers are often hard pressed to personalize learning for the
                                individual child. Differentiated
                                teaching is hard to manage in the west, even with extra helper teachers in a class.</p>

                            <p>Can a teacher with 20 or more children in a class personalize learning so that every
                                child excels or is this expectation
                                an oxymoron? The experimental underpinnings of a personalised learning programme began
                                in Aslandsskoli, Hafnarfjordur,
                                in Iceland, in 2000. It was the beginning of an experiment with the help of some amazing
                                individuals: Bodvar Jonsson and
                                Steinunn Gudnadottir, Gudrun Petursdottir, Jonina Bjartmas, Hanna Ragnarsdottir and
                                others with whom we started

                            <strong>All change begins with a thought. If we were to re-imagine education in the 21st

                        <p>Education is the most complex and challenging issue of our times. It is not just a local or a
                            national concern but a
                            subject of great deliberation worldwide. Even as the world has witnessed vast advances
                            towards globalization and
                            technology makes life much easier, education remains largely unchanged with its19th century
                            objectives and old ethics
                            intact. Current education, like an old injection with an expired date, has at best an
                            uncertain outcome, the goals of
                            which are at odds with the needs of the 21st century.</p>

                        <p>TS Eliot once wrote: “It is in fact a part of the function of education to help us escape
                            from the intellectual and
                            emotional limitations of our own time.”</p>

                        <p>Surely, the change we need in education today is far more than reduce the weight of our
                            children's school bag, replace a
                            few books, integrate the multiple intelligences or better technology, and train our teachers
                            in the methods that
                            accelerate learning? Through education, we can unravel the gems hidden in each child and
                            enable each child to become, at
